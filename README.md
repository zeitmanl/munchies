# munchies
Munchies is a game that was originally created by Michael Fan.

This is a Java reproduction of the first few levels of that game using the original artwork, music, and sounds.

The object is to eat all the food and avoid the skulls, which cause you to lose a life.
This game is originally for PowerPC, so I ran an emulator and used ResEdit to extract the images, music, and sounds.

The original game can be found here: http://www.mikefan.com/munchies/

To run this game, you'll need Greenfoot. Greenfoot is a free Java/Stride IDE available at https://www.greenfoot.org/download

Once you've downloaded Greenfoot and all the files in the repository, simply open the .gfar file.
